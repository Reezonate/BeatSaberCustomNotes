## Notes on score submission
While using a Custom Note and playing with the "Ghost Notes" or "Disappearing Arrows" modifier turned on, score submission will be temporarily disabled.
By switching to the default notes, enabling "Auto Disable Custom Notes" or turning off these modifiers, score submission will be re-enabled. No need for a game restart!
